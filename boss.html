      counter. Let me know if anyone you know is interested.

      <h4>Robert:</h4>My sister was actually looking for a customer service job and she has a detailed CV about it. When
      would be the best time for her to drop by?
    </article>
    <article class="tl t3 box">Sorry Robert. Iâ€™ve just been informed that we are supposed to cut down some hours on all
      employees. Canâ€™t take anyone in for the time being.
      <p>What I mean to say is that I don't need anyone full time. Part time
        employees don't have access to dental covering, insurance, or other
        kind of benefits that full time employees have. But this is the part you don't need to know.

      <h4>Robert:</h4>Hey! Since weâ€™re cutting down some hours, can you cut some of mine? My school workload is intense
      with the approaching finals. I could use some of this time. Iâ€™d like to cut down one day out of the 4 days I work
      this week If possible.

    </article>
    <article class="tl t5"> Listen, I know how hard it was at your age. I used to have finals, football practice, and a
      girl to keep up with. If I was able to manage it back then, Iâ€™m sure you can make it happen too! You Are organized
      and incredibly reliable, Iâ€™m sure you can make it work!
    </article>
    <article class="tr t6">â€¦How come you cut down Missyâ€™s hours because you assumed she has too much homework but canâ€™t
      do it for me?
    </article>
    <article class="tl t7">Her department has more people who can cover for her, yours on the other hand is
      understaffed, sadly we donâ€™t have anyone to cover for it. Please, we need you!
    </article>
    <article class="tr t8">How come we donâ€™t have any new recruits? Itâ€™s been months since you said you were going to do
      the interviews?
    </article>
    <article class="tl t9 box">Nobody applies. It's a hard time. I will keep working on it. Just hang in there a little
      bit longer!
      <p>I know thereâ€™s literally 5 new people in the store but currently, nobody applies for YOUR department
        specifically. </p>

    <article class="tl t16">Listen, what If I use some of the company budget that we saved up for a 50$ gift card from our store?
