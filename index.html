            hero of a movie__Everyone depends on you to keep
            the plot going, but youre still stuck in the background
            eating popcorn with no extra butter. You're like the
            real-life MVP (Minimum Value Player), keeping the show
            running while your paycheck does the disappearing act faster
            than a magician on caffeine. Talk about being unpaid
            and overworked: it's the modern-day joke of errors where
            the punchline is your salary!"

                <h3>Scenario: John D. [Your Friendly Supervisor]</h3>Despite employees' rights, some employers and higher ups find
                gray zones/ loopholes that
                allow them to lower someone’s worth without getting in trouble with the law. Using manipulation, gas
                lighting, threats and guilt tripping actions into loyalty of their workers. And not everyone can afford
                losing their position as it’s their only source of income. Some examples can be seen with
                waiters/waitresses, retail stores, minimum-wage workers, part-time students, intern stages, newly
                employed, or even those who had been working in the same environment for a long period of time.</p>

                <h3>Scenario: Missy C. [Young Coworker]</h3>As the labor situation got worse in 2022, some companies started
                using tactics that went against their main strategies.(1) Changes in labor policies can stir controversy
                and may involve those gray areas concerning worker rights, job security, wage laws, and regulations
                related to labor unions. Certain reforms might simplify the process for employers to hire or dismiss
                workers, raising worries about job security and potential unfair treatment. Changes to minimum wage laws
                can unintentionally result in consequences like job reduction or employers to hire workers off the
                records. (3)</p>
